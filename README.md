Search Algorithms in Tree of Thoughts

The Tree of Thoughts library supports a variety of search algorithms that can be employed for different problem-solving contexts. Here's a brief overview of each search algorithm along with their primary benefits and use-cases.
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS explores all the nodes at the present depth before going on to the nodes at the next depth level. It is an excellent choice when the depth of the tree is relatively small, and solutions are spread out evenly.

Benefits:

    It guarantees to find the shallowest goal, i.e., the solution with fewer steps.
    It is a simple and straightforward algorithm for traversing trees or graphs.

Use-cases:

    Ideal for problems where the depth of the tree/graph is not very large.
    Useful when the goal is close to the root.

2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backing up. It is suitable when the tree depth is significant, and solutions are located deep in the tree.

Benefits:

    It uses less memory compared to BFS as it needs to store only a single path from the root to a leaf node, along with remaining unexplored sibling nodes for each node on the path.
    It can explore deeper solutions that are not accessible with BFS.

Use-cases:

    It is often used in simulations due to its more aggressive (deeper) search.
    Ideal for searching through a big search space.

3. Best-First Search

Best-First Search uses an evaluation function to decide which adjacent node is most promising and then explores. It is suitable for problems where we have some heuristic information about the distance from the current state to the goal.

Benefits:

    It can provide a more efficient solution by using heuristics.
    It does not explore unnecessary paths, thus saving resources.

Use-cases:

    Suitable for a large dataset where the goal node's location is unknown.
    Ideal for problems where some heuristic can guide the search to the goal.

4. A* Search

A* Search finds the least-cost path from the given initial node to one goal node (out of one or more possible goals). It uses a best-first search and finds the least-cost path to a goal.

Benefits:

    It is complete, optimal, optimally efficient, and uses heuristics to guide itself.
    A* balances between BFS and DFS and avoids expanding paths that are already expensive.

Use-cases:

    Widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal, the process of plotting an efficiently directed path between multiple points.
    Suitable for games, mapping apps, and routing paths for vehicles where we need an optimal solution.

5. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

MCTS uses random sampling of the search space and uses the results to guide the search. It is best when the search space is vast and cannot be completely traversed.

Benefits:

    It can provide good solutions for extremely complex problems with a large search space, where traditional methods fail.
    It uses statistical analysis of the results for decision making, which can handle the uncertainty and variability in the problem.

Use-cases:

    Suitable for "perfect information" games, which are games where players have complete knowledge of all events and states.
    Also useful in real-time video games and other domains where the decision-making time is limited.
